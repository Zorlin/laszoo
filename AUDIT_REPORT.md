# Laszoo README.md Audit Report

## Overview
This document audits the features documented in README.md against the actual implementation.

## Implemented Features ✅

### Core Commands
1. **enroll** - Implemented with all documented options:
   - Basic enrollment: `laszoo enroll <group> <path>`
   - Machine-specific: `--machine`
   - Hybrid mode: `--hybrid`
   - Actions: `--before/--start`, `--after/--end`
   - Sync actions: `--action` (converge, rollback, freeze, drift)

2. **unenroll** - Implemented
   - Remove specific files from group
   - Remove all files from group

3. **sync** - Implemented with strategies:
   - Auto, Rollback, Forward, Converge, Freeze, Drift
   - Works with local vs template comparison (not cross-host as README suggests)

4. **status** - Implemented
   - Shows enrolled files and their status
   - `--detailed` flag for more information

5. **apply** - Implemented
   - Apply group templates to local system
   - Can apply specific files or all files

6. **group** - Implemented with subcommands:
   - add: Add machine to group
   - remove: Remove machine from group
   - list: List machines in group
   - rename: Rename group

7. **groups list** - Implemented
   - Lists all existing groups

8. **watch** - Implemented
   - Monitor enrolled files for changes
   - `--auto` flag for automatic application
   - `--hard` flag for propagating deletions

9. **install** - Implemented
   - Install packages on all systems in group
   - `--after` flag for post-install commands

10. **patch** - Implemented
    - Apply package updates to group
    - `--before` and `--after` flags
    - `--rolling` flag for rolling updates

11. **commit** - Implemented
    - Manual git commits with AI-generated messages
    - Uses Ollama when available

12. **init** - Implemented
    - Initialize Laszoo with MooseFS mount point

### Features
1. **Git Integration** - Implemented
   - Automatic commits during watch mode
   - AI-generated commit messages with Ollama
   - Fallback to generic messages

2. **Template System** - Implemented
   - Handlebars variables: `{{ variable }}`
   - Quack tags: `[[x content x]]`
   - Hybrid mode with `{{ quack }}` placeholders

3. **Package Management** - Implemented
   - Package operations in packages.conf
   - Metapackages: ++update, ++upgrade
   - Package prefixes: +install, ^upgrade, =keep, !remove, !!!purge

4. **Group Membership** - Implemented
   - Symlinks in /mnt/laszoo/memberships/<group>/<hostname>
   - Machine manifests track group membership

## Missing Features ❌

1. **rollback** command - Stub only, not implemented
   - Shows "Rollback not yet implemented" message

2. **diff** command - Not implemented at all
   - Should show differences between local files and templates

3. **report** command - Not implemented at all
   - Should generate compliance reports

4. **act** command - Not implemented
   - Should manage persistent before/after actions
   - Note: Actions are supported via enrollment flags, but not as standalone command

5. **ignore** command - Not implemented
   - Should mark files to be ignored

6. **Auto-commit on enrollment** - Not implemented
   - Currently only commits during watch mode
   - Should commit after each enrollment

## Directory Structure Discrepancies

### README states:
```
/mnt/laszoo/
├── logs/          # Not created/used
├── actions/       # Not created/used
├── machines/
├── groups/
└── memberships/   # Implemented recently
```

### Actual structure:
```
/mnt/laszoo/
├── .git/          # Git repository (not mentioned in README)
├── machines/
├── groups/
└── memberships/
```

## Implementation Differences

1. **Sync Command**
   - README implies cross-host synchronization
   - Actually compares local files with templates
   - More like template enforcement than host-to-host sync

2. **Machine Templates**
   - Currently flattens directory structure (bug)
   - Should maintain full path: machines/<hostname>/<full/path/to/file>.lasz

3. **Package Management**
   - README mentions machine-specific packages.conf taking precedence
   - Implementation doesn't show machine-specific package handling

4. **Update Automation**
   - README mentions watching machine folder for commands
   - Implementation doesn't show this feature

5. **Converge Mode**
   - merge_file_changes_to_template not implemented
   - Currently just forwards local content to template

## Test Coverage

Existing tests:
- enrollment_test.rs
- group_test.rs  
- template_test.rs
- sync_test.rs
- package_test.rs
- git_test.rs
- actions_test.rs
- membership_symlinks_test.rs
- integration_test.rs

Missing test coverage:
- Diff functionality (not implemented)
- Report functionality (not implemented)
- Rollback functionality (not implemented)
- Act command (not implemented)
- Ignore command (not implemented)
- Auto-commit on enrollment
- Machine-specific package management
- Update automation features

## Recommendations

1. **Update README.md** to reflect actual implementation
2. **Implement missing commands**: diff, report, act, ignore
3. **Fix rollback** command implementation
4. **Add auto-commit** on enrollment
5. **Fix machine template** directory structure
6. **Implement converge** merge functionality
7. **Add comprehensive tests** for all features
8. **Document actual** directory structure
9. **Clarify sync** behavior in documentation
10. **Add machine-specific** package management
